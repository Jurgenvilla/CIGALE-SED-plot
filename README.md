# SED cool plots

This is a code to plot SED data from CIGALE in a very crude fashion. I used it to create nice plots in dark mode inspired by a presentation of Fédéric Galliano to show different components of SEDs for my Ph.D. defense. The data I used is one of my galaxies from the FMOS-COSMOS survey which I fitted with CIGALE for my Ph.D. thesis project. Feel free to use it and adapt it to your needs and probably improve it.
